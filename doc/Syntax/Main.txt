This document specifies how to use the TuringMachine program itself.

You must specify in input file (preceded by a -I flag)
You can have the command switches v, s, c, and o.
v - Verbose - every step through the input is displayed
s - Setp - the Turing machine pauses at each step
c - Clear - The screen is cleared after every step
o - Output - the currently loaded file is output in the syntax used by the online turing machine simulator

If -o is set, you also need to specify an output file with -O
