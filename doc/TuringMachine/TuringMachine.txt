A turing machine takes an input and manipulates it
by moving the tape. It can read and write symbols on the tape.

Functions:

makeTuringMachine()
	Returns a new, blank TuringMachine. This function is not
	useful unless you want to manually set every state.
	Use loadTuringMachineFromFile instead

	returns - a pointer to a new, blank TuringMachine

freeTuringMachine(TuringMachine* tm)
	Frees a turing machine from memory

	tm - the turing machine to free

_Bool loadTuringMachineFromFile(TuringMachine* tm, char* fileName, char* errorMessage, int errorMessageSize)
	Loads a Turing Machine from a file
	
	tm - a Turing Machine that any rules loaded from the given file will be added to.
		Overwrites any existing rules
	fileName - the name of the file to load
	errorMessage - a buffer to save the error message to if the file fails to load. Must
		be sufficiently long to store an error message, or nothing will be stored in it.
	errorMessageSize - the length of the errorMessage buffer

	return - true if the Turing Machine was loaded successfully, or false otherwise.

void ExecuteInput(TuringMachine* tm, char* input, _Bool verbose, _Bool step, _Bool clear)
	Executes the given input on the given turing machine

	tm - the turing machine to use
	input - the input to put on the tape
	verbose - whether or not you want the Turing Machine to output every step
	step - if true, the Turing Machine will pause and wait for you to press enter before
		executing the next rule. Ignored if verbose is set to false.
	clear - if true, the output will be cleared after each step
