# TuringMachine
This is an implementaiton of a Turing machine, written in C. A Turing Machine is a simple representation of a computer, consisting a set of states and
an infinite tape. The input for the machine is put on the infinite tape, and the input from the tape determines what action the Turing
machine will take. For a more detailed description of a turing machine, check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) article
on Turing machines.

## How to build this project
First, ensure that the project is cloned to your local machine. Then, simply using the `make` command will build the binary.

Instructions on using the project can be found in the doc directory of this repository.

Note that I wrote this project in my spare time, so documentation is limited. I plan on revisiting this project in the future and writing
more comprehensive documentation on how to use this project.
